@kathiharsha,"Questions with in detailed answers:<br>===============================<br><br>1. Why is Java not 100% object-oriented?<br>Java is not considered 100% object-oriented because it uses primitive data types (e.g., int, char, boolean) which are not objects. These types are used for performance optimization, avoiding the overhead of object creation. To work with primitive types as objects, Java provides wrapper classes (e.g., Integer, Character). Additionally, certain keywords like static and null also do not align with the principles of object-oriented programming.<br><br>2. Why are pointers not used in Java?<br>Java does not use pointers to enhance security and simplify programming.<br><br>Security: Direct memory access through pointers can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows.<br>Simplicity: Managing pointers can make the code more complex and error-prone. Java abstracts memory management with features like garbage collection, making it developer-friendly and less error-prone compared to languages like C/C++.<br>3. What is a JIT compiler in Java?<br>The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is a part of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that improves performance by compiling bytecode into native machine code at runtime.<br><br>How it works: The JVM first interprets the bytecode. When a method is called frequently, the JIT compiler compiles it into machine code for faster execution.<br>Benefit: This hybrid approach of interpretation and compilation enhances Java‚Äôs performance while retaining its platform independence.<br>4. Why is String immutable in Java?<br>The immutability of String in Java offers several advantages:<br><br>Security: Strings are used in sensitive operations like database connections and file paths. Being immutable ensures these values cannot be altered maliciously.<br>Caching: String literals are stored in a String pool, and immutability allows reusability without creating duplicate objects.<br>Thread Safety: Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe, as their state cannot change after creation.<br>5. What is a marker interface?<br>A marker interface is an interface that has no methods or fields but is used to signal a specific capability or behavior to the JVM or compiler.<br><br>Examples: Serializable, Cloneable, Remote.<br>Purpose: It is used as a &quot;tag&quot; to indicate that a class has a specific property. For example, implementing Serializable tells the JVM that the class objects can be serialized.<br>6. Can you override a private or static method in Java?<br>Private methods: Cannot be overridden because they are not visible to subclasses. They are bound at compile time.<br>Static methods: Cannot be overridden because they belong to the class, not an instance. However, you can hide a static method by defining a method with the same name in the subclass.<br>7. Does finally always execute in Java?<br>The finally block in Java is almost always executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught.<br><br>Exception: It won‚Äôt execute if the JVM terminates abruptly (e.g., System.exit(), power failure).<br>8. What methods does the Object class have?<br>The Object class provides these methods, which are inherited by all Java classes:<br><br>clone() ‚Äì Creates a copy of the object.<br>equals(Object obj) ‚Äì Checks for equality between objects.<br>finalize() ‚Äì Called by the garbage collector before object destruction.<br>getClass() ‚Äì Returns the runtime class of the object.<br>hashCode() ‚Äì Returns the hash code of the object.<br>notify() ‚Äì Wakes up a thread waiting on the object&#39;s monitor.<br>notifyAll() ‚Äì Wakes up all threads waiting on the object&#39;s monitor.<br>toString() ‚Äì Returns a string representation of the object.<br>wait() ‚Äì Causes the thread to wait until it is notified.<br>9. How can you make a class immutable?<br>To make a class immutable:<br><br>Declare the class as final so it cannot be extended.<br>Make all fields private and final to prevent modification after initialization.<br>Do not provide setter methods.<br>Initialize fields through the constructor only.<br>Ensure deep copying for mutable objects passed to or returned from the class to prevent external modification.<br>Example:<br><br>java<br>Copy code<br>final class ImmutableClass {<br>    private final String name;<br><br>    public ImmutableClass(String name) {<br>        <a href=""http://this.name/"">this.name</a> = name;<br>    }<br><br>    public String getName() {<br>        return name;<br>    }<br>}<br>10. What is a singleton class in Java, and how can we make a class singleton?<br>A singleton class ensures that only one instance of the class is created throughout the application.<br><br>Steps to create a Singleton class:<br><br>Private constructor: Prevents direct instantiation.<br>Static instance: Holds the single instance of the class.<br>Public static method: Provides access to the single instance.<br>Example:<br><br>java<br>Copy code<br>public class Singleton {<br>    private static Singleton instance;<br><br>    private Singleton() {<br>        // Private constructor<br>    }<br><br>    public static Singleton getInstance() {<br>        if (instance == null) {<br>            instance = new Singleton();<br>        }<br>        return instance;<br>    }<br>}<br>Thread-safe Singleton (Using synchronized or Double-Checked Locking):<br><br>java<br>Copy code<br>public class Singleton {<br>    private static volatile Singleton instance;<br><br>    private Singleton() {<br>    }<br><br>    public static Singleton getInstance() {<br>        if (instance == null) {<br>            synchronized (Singleton.class) {<br>                if (instance == null) {<br>                    instance = new Singleton();<br>                }<br>            }<br>        }<br>        return instance;<br>    }<br>}<br>This ensures only one instance is created, even in multithreaded environments.",1,2025-01-02T17:23:57Z

@shambhavirai,"Imagine if someone gave you a set of tasks in German. Interpreter reads the tasks as he goes, translates each task into English, and then does the task. Every time he does a German task, he has to translate it again...even if he already did a similar task or the exact same task before. A JIT keeps often used tasks translated in English and refers back as needed. If a task is executed only once, it often does the same thing that an interpreter does. AOT compilers translate all tasks into English before executing them.",0,2024-10-14T12:14:24Z

@consistentlearners,"Thanks for making such videos. These videos are very helpful for interview preparation. <br>I would like to correct you on one question mentioned in the above video related to JIT compiler. The probable accurate answer to it would be below answer.<br><br>When a Java program is executed, the JVM interprets the bytecode one instruction at a time. This process is relatively slow, because each bytecode instruction must be interpreted by the JVM. However, when the JVM encounters a loop or frequently executed code, the JIT compiler compiles that bytecode to native machine code and caches the result, so that subsequent executions of the same code can be executed more quickly.",47,2023-05-13T03:35:24Z
